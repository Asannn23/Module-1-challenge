## Result
Since launching Alonzo hardfork last September, Cardano has been struggling onboard Web.3 developer to its network due its conccurrency issue.

There is metric called blockchain trillemma: it is score of a blockchain's decentralization, scalability and security.
cardano is performing really well on decentralazation and security. currently it is  estimated there are over 2000 active validator pool that secure the net work.
cardano has been struggling with scalability due to concurrency issues since the smart contract launch, however there will be a recent update call "Vasil hardfork" which will boost its transaction speed performance


## Recommendations

Cardano needs to hire a better marketing team to clear communicate their visions and developement progress. There is a huge misconception from the crypto community in regards to its blockchain product due to unreasonable expectation from its investor. Most of the investor belived majority of the Dapps that building on its blockchain will release early 2022 however lately they found out the major launce date will be after "vasil hardfor" which is 29th of June 2022.
